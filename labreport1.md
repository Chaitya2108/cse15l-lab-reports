## The `cd` command
1. No arguments
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
* Before the `cd` command was run, the working directory was `home`.
* Since an argument was not given, the `cd` command changed into the root directory, which was `home`. Since we were already in the `home` directory, nothing happened.
* There is no output, so no error occurs.
